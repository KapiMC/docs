# Your First Plugin

After [setting up Kapi](./01-setup.md), you can still use Spigot as usual
and only use the Kapi features you need.  
This is absolutey fine! you can skip this tutorial and start working on your plugin!

If you stayed, this tutorial will walk you through how to make a simple plugin,
while teaching you how to use Kapi.
