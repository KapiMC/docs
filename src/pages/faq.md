Why use Kapi over something like Spigot / Paper?
</summary>
As a longtime user of the Spigot API, I became frustrated with how minimal it is. Even basic tasks required too much boilerplate, and every time I started a new project, I found myself copy pasting the same utility functions over and over again.

I built Kapi to solve this problem by offering a "batteries included" framework that simplifies plugin development, allowing you to build both simple and complex plugins with ease.
